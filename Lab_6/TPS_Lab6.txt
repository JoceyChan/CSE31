Activity 1:
1. The starting addresses
   1. Text segment: 0x00400000
   2.  Data Segment: 0x1001000
2. The source one has more detail, sometimes it can not be translated into machine code.
3. Between 2 address location there is a difference of 32 bits.
4. There are 8 columns
5. The relationship between the address difference and the number of columns are 4 bits
6. You create a variable name from the source code by using m and then a colon and then .word and then value and then .word and value again. 
7. The address that value m is stored in is 0x10010000
8. Code
9. Str 1 is stored in address 0x00400018 
10. The display characters agree with what I learned from Lab#4 about how array characters are stored.
11. Code
12. 0x0000000d is the value stored


Activity 2:
1. If you have less operations then you have to use less software and would run faster.
2. Code
3. Code
4. Code
5. Code
6.
