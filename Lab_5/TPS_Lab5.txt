Activity 1:
1. MARS is an interactive development environment for programing in MIPS
      4)
1. An assembly file is loaded by going to file and opening a folder in which you can pick the file you want to use. 
2. You assemble the program by first saving your program and then by going to the run tab and hitting the assemble button
3. You run the the assembled program by going to the run tab and hitting the run button 
4. You can not run a program before assembling it, as that option is not available till the assemble button is pressed on.
5. If you want to run the assembled program line by line you have to go back to the run tab and select the step option 
6. You backstep to rerun the program or re do the whole process or just selecting the go option in run.


Activity 2:
1. .txt, .word, and .data are assembler directives .
   1. .text is an assembly instruction follows
   2. .data is data follows
2. Line 10 indicates that if branch registers are equal registers 3 to 0 then finish program
3. Line 15 puts it into a j format which is 6 bits and 26 bits. 
4. A breakpoint in MARS is set by viewing the execute tab and then using the text segment click breakpoint check box. This will set a breakpoint. 
5. Using f5 to run the code after the breakpoint and f7 to step
6. First you have to reset your stimulation and then re-run your code which will stop at breakpoint and then to view it you double click in the memory locations and you can enter a different value. Then you just press the run button again and it will run after breakpoint.
7. 0x00000000 +10 = 0x00000010 is the address that is stored in nth section. The calculation of the 13th fib number is 233 which is shown when you put a breakpoint at 13
8. Line 19 and 21 use the syscall instruction to call extra external tool/functions--calls a syscall that will point into an integer which theen exist to set an argument and put it into argument $v0.
